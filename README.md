# Ð¡ryptoanalyser
## Brief description
This program is for encrypting and decrypting text files using the [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher). Program modes:
* encryption text using a cipher key;
* decryption text using a cipher key;
* decryption by brute force method (key search);
* decryption by statistical text analysis (key search).

To launch the program:
1. Download cryptoanalyser-v-0.0.1.jar file.
2. Enter a command at the command prompt _(pre-navigate to the folder with the cryptoanalyser-v-0.0.1.jar file or use the absolute (full) path to the file)_:
```
java -jar cryptoanalyser-v-0.0.1.jar
```
## Limitation
The program works exclusively with .txt files and only with the English alphabet (including punctuation characters).
## Brief description of classes
In the ```basic``` package is the ```Main``` class, which is the entry point to the program.

Package ```exception``` has ```FileProcessingException``` - exceptions generated by classes that work with files.

Package ```files```:
* ```CaesarsCipher``` - contains all the logic of encrypting / decrypting files
* ```FileChecking``` - check files and write their paths in the Artifacts class variables
* ```FileProcessing``` - read the input file and write to the output file

Package ```model```:
* ```Alphabet``` - contains an array of characters that are used for encryption and decryption processes
* ```Artifacts``` - contains setting and getting methods file paths and a cipher key
* ```Dialog``` - communication of the program with the user
